   <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 15px;">My name is Abu Abdul Mustafa Muhammad Rohail, and my passion for history ignited during my 
      6th-grade studies. By the time I reached the 10th grade in May 2022, I was dismayed by the prevalence of inaccurate historical 
      information circulating widely. This realization prompted me to initiate "History with Rohail," a personal endeavor dedicated to 
      unraveling and presenting accurate historical accounts.Through meticulous research and rigorous verification, my goal is to dispel 
      misconceptions and highlight the truths that often get overshadowed. "History with Rohail" seeks not only to educate but also to inspire 
      a critical examination of historical narratives. By promoting a deeper understanding of the past, I aim to equip individuals with the 
      knowledge needed to navigate the complexities of our world today.I firmly believe that history is more than just a collection of facts; 
      it provides us with insights into human behavior, societal evolution, and the consequences of our actions. By presenting history 
      accurately, I hope to foster a greater appreciation for the lessons it offers and encourage informed decision-making for the future.
      In essence, "History with Rohail" is my commitment to contributing to a more nuanced and truthful understanding of our shared past, 
      empowering individuals to engage critically with historical discourse and shaping a more informed and enlightened society.</p>
